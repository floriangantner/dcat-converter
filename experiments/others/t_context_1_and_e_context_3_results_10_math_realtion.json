    "Since both 'Title' and 'Title' have the same definition, they are equivalent to each other. \n\nIn terms of a formula, it can be represented as:\n\nTitle1 = Title2\n\nIn JSON, it can be represented as:\n\n{\n  \"Title1\": \"A name given to the resource\",\n  \"Title2\": \"A name given to the resource\"\n}\n\nSince both Title1 and Title2 have the same value, they are equivalent. \n\n{\n  \"Equivalent\": {\n    \"Title1\": \"A name given to the resource\",\n    \"Title2\": \"A name given to the resource\"\n  }\n}\n\nIn terms of subsets, since they are equivalent, they are also subsets of each other. \n\n{\n  \"Subset\": {\n    \"Title1\": \"A name given to the resource\",\n    \"Title2\": \"A name given to the resource\"\n  }\n}\n\nThis means that all elements of Title1 are also in Title2, and vice versa. \n\n{\n  \"Subset and Equivalent\": {\n    \"Title1\": \"A name given to the resource\",\n    \"Title2\": \"A name given to the resource\"\n  }\n}",
    "No, 'Title' and 'Creator' do not have a subset of or equivalent to each other. They represent two different aspects of a resource. 'Title' is the name given to the resource, while 'Creator' is the entity primarily responsible for making the resource. They are two distinct properties and neither is a subset or equivalent of the other.\n\nIn terms of a formula, it would look something like this:\n\nResource = {Title, Creator}\n\nIn JSON, it would look like this:\n\n1. \n{\n  \"Title\": \"Resource Name\",\n  \"Creator\": \"Resource Creator\"\n}\n\n2. \n{\n  \"Title\": \"Another Resource Name\",\n  \"Creator\": \"Another Resource Creator\"\n}\n\n3. \n{\n  \"Title\": \"Yet Another Resource Name\",\n  \"Creator\": \"Yet Another Resource Creator\"\n}\n\n4. \n{\n  \"Title\": \"Different Resource Name\",\n  \"Creator\": \"Different Resource Creator\"\n}\n\n5. \n{\n  \"Title\": \"Final Resource Name\",\n  \"Creator\": \"Final Resource Creator\"\n}",
    "No, 'Title' and 'Subject' are not subsets or equivalent of each other. They are two distinct properties of a resource. The 'Title' is the name or label of the resource, while the 'Subject' is the topic or content of the resource. \n\nIn JSON, these properties can be represented as key-value pairs.

    "No, 'Title' and 'Description' are not subsets or equivalent of each other. They are distinct properties of a resource. \n\nIn a JSON object, they would be represented as separate key-value pairs. Here's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Title\": \"The Great Gatsby\",\n  \"Description\": \"A novel written by American author F. Scott Fitzgerald that follows a cast of characters living in the fictional towns of West Egg and East Egg on prosperous Long Island in the summer of 1922.\"\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, 'Title' is the name of the resource (a book in this case), and 'Description' provides more detailed information about the resource.\n\nHere are five resulting formulas in JSON:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Title\": \"Moby Dick\",\n  \"Description\": \"A novel by Herman Melville, in which the obsessive quest of Ahab, captain of the whaler the Pequod, for revenge on Moby Dick, the white whale that on the previous whaling voyage bit off Ahab's leg at the knee.\"\n}\n\n{\n  \"Title\": \"The Catcher in the Rye\",\n  \"Description\": \"A novel by J.

    "No, 'Title' and 'Publisher' are not subsets or equivalent of each other. They represent different aspects of a resource. 'Title' is the name of the resource, while 'Publisher' is the entity that makes the resource available. They are two distinct properties of a resource.\n\nIn JSON, this could be represented as:\n\n```\n{\n  \"resource\": {\n    \"title\": \"Example Title\",\n    \"publisher\": \"Example Publisher\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis shows that 'Title' and 'Publisher' are two separate properties of the 'resource' object. They are not subsets or equivalent of each other. \n\nHere are five resulting formulas in JSON:\n\n1. \n```\n{\n  \"resource\": {\n    \"title\": \"Book One\",\n    \"publisher\": \"Publisher One\"\n  }\n}\n```\n2. \n```\n{\n  \"resource\": {\n    \"title\": \"Article Two\",\n    \"publisher\": \"Publisher Two\"\n  }\n}\n```\n3. \n```\n{\n  \"resource\": {\n    \"title\": \"Report Three\",\n    \"publisher\": \"Publisher Three\"\n  }\n}\n```\n4. \n```\n{\n  \"resource\": {\n    \"title\": \"Journal Four\",\n    \"publisher\": \"Publisher Four\"\n  }\n}\n```\n5. \n```\n{\n  \"resource\": {\n    \"title\": \"Paper Five\",\n    \"publisher\": \"Publisher Five\"\n  }\n}\n```",
    "No, 'Title' and 'Contributor' do not have a subset of or equivalent each other. They are two distinct properties of a resource. \n\nA 'Title' is a unique identifier for a resource, while a 'Contributor' is an entity that has contributed to the creation or development of the resource. \n\nIn JSON, these properties would be represented as separate key-value pairs. For example:\n\n{\n  \"Title\": \"The Great Gatsby\",\n  \"Contributor\": \"F. Scott Fitzgerald\"\n}\n\nHere, \"The Great Gatsby\" is the title of the resource and \"F. Scott Fitzgerald\" is the contributor. \n\nThe relationship between 'Title' and 'Contributor' can be represented as a formula in set theory as follows:\n\nTitle \u2229 Contributor = \u2205\n\nThis formula states that the intersection of 'Title' and 'Contributor' is an empty set, meaning they do not share any elements.\n\nIn JSON, this would be represented as:\n\n[\n  {\n    \"Title\": \"The Great Gatsby\",\n    \"Contributor\": \"F.

    "No, 'Title' and 'Type' are not subsets or equivalent of each other. They represent different aspects of a resource.

    "No, 'Title' and 'Format' are not subsets or equivalent of each other. They represent different aspects of a resource. 'Title' is the name or identifier of the resource, while 'Format' describes the physical or digital manifestation of the resource.\n\nIn JSON, these could be represented as separate key-value pairs within an object. For example:\n\n{\n  \"Title\": \"Example Resource\",\n  \"Format\": \"text/html\"\n}\n\nThis shows that 'Title' and 'Format' are distinct properties of the resource object, neither being a subset or equivalent of the other. \n\nFive resulting formulas in JSON could be:\n\n1. \n{\n  \"Title\": \"Resource 1\",\n  \"Format\": \"image/jpeg\"\n}\n\n2. \n{\n  \"Title\": \"Resource 2\",\n  \"Format\": \"application/pdf\"\n}\n\n3. \n{\n  \"Title\": \"Resource 3\",\n  \"Format\": \"audio/mpeg\"\n}\n\n4. \n{\n  \"Title\": \"Resource 4\",\n  \"Format\": \"video/mp4\"\n}\n\n5. \n{\n  \"Title\": \"Resource 5\",\n  \"Format\": \"text/plain\"\n}",
