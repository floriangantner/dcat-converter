Answer:
The best match for an element in Ontology1 is an element in Ontology2 that has the same name and the same substitution group. 
For example, if the element in Ontology1 is "title", the best match in Ontology2 is "title" with substitution group "dc:title".

Note that some elements in Ontology2 have multiple names and substitution groups, so you may need to examine the specific elements in each ontology to determine the best match.
