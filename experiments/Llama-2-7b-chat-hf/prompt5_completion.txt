I have tried to match the elements of the two ontologies using the following rules:

1. Element name matching: If the element name in ontology 2 matches the element name in ontology 1, then the elements are considered to be matching. For example, the element "title" in ontology 1 matches the element "title" in ontology 2.
2. Substitution group matching: If the element in ontology 2 has a substitution group that matches the element in ontology 1, then the elements are considered to be matching. For example, the element "creator" in ontology 1 matches the element "creator" in ontology 2 because they have the same substitution group.
3. Element hierarchy matching: If the element in ontology 2 is a child of an element in ontology 1, then the elements are considered to be matching. For example, the element "description" in ontology 1 is a child of the element "dc:description", so the element "description" in ontology 2 is considered to be matching with the element "dc:description" in ontology 1.
4. Element attribute matching: If the attributes of the element in ontology 2 match the attributes of the element in ontology 1, then the elements are considered to be matching. For example, the element "title" in ontology 1 has the attribute "lang", and the element "title" in ontology 2 also has the attribute "lang", so the elements are considered to be matching.

Using these rules, I have matched the elements of the two ontologies as follows:

Matched elements:

* creator
* subject
* description
* publisher

* date
* type
* format
* identifier

* educationLevel
* accessRights
* license
* bibliographicCitation

Note that some elements in ontology 2 do not have a match in ontology 1, and some elements in ontology 1 have multiple matches in ontology 2. This is because the elements in the two ontologies are not identical, and there are some differences in their structure and content.
